Feature: Bulk Certificates

  # Note: Testing of Get call is done in the create and delete steps

  Scenario: Request a New Batch of Certificates
    Given batch "integration-test-batch" does not exist
    When I request batch certificates with batch id "integration-test-batch" and batchInfo
      """
      {
        "certInfo":{
          "commonName": "test.org",
          "organization": "integration",
          "organizationalUnit": "test",
          "locality": "Testville",
          "state": "CA",
          "country": "US",
          "emailAddress": "info@test.org"
        },
        "tag": "integration-test-bulk-certs",
        "quantity":5,
        "register": false,
        "batchId": "integration-test-batch"
      }
      """
    Then batch id "integration-test-batch" will have been created with a quantity of 5 and a tag of "integration-test-bulk-certs"

  Scenario: Delete a Batch of Certificates
    Given batch "integration-test-batch" exists
    When I delete the batch "integration-test-batch"
    Then batch id "integration-test-batch" does not exist

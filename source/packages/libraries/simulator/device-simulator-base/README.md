# CDF DEVICE SIMULATOR BASE OVERVIEW

## Introduction

This library contains the reusable components of a device simulator such as the management of the state machine, AWS IoT connectivity, message construction, and a calculations engine. 

To create a device simulator from these reusable components the high level steps are:

* state machine design
* telemetry message design
* shadow implementation
* calculations design and implementation
* state machine implementation
* telemetry message implementation
* wiring everything up
* launching
